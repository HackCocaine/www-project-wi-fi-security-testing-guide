This project is set to create a standard for Wi-Fi testing. It will include procedures, common vulnerabilities and recommendations.

### Road Map
First, a draft of the testing guide will be created, then it will be revised and once the structure is done, a more refined step by step approach will be added, including the vulnerabilities related to each test, as well as recommendations and best practices.
